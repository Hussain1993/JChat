<p>This is a java based Client/Server messaging system, where the user has the choice to </br>
use either one of two interfaces: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Command Line Interface</li>
	<li>Graphical User Interface for both the server and the client (Screenshots can be seen below)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a screenshot showing the server GUI where the server logs every message that </br>
is passed through the system.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of the client GUI, showing two instances of the application running</br>
to show how the messages are being passed from one client to another.</p>
